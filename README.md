# VBA Stock Analysis #

Created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
<ul> 
   <li> The ticker symbol </li>
   <li>Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year </li>
   <li> The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year </li>
   <li>The total stock volume of the stock </li>
 </ul>
* Add conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

* Return the stocks with the Greatest percent increase, Greatest percent decrease and Greatest total volume.

* Make the appropriate adjustments to the VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
