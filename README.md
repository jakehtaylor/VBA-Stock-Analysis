# VBA Stock Analysis #

Created a script that will run once and loop through an entire workbook of excel sheets of yearly stock market data and output the following information:

<ul> 
   <li> The ticker symbol </li>
   <li>Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year </li>
   <li> The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year </li>
   <li>The total stock volume of the stock </li>
 </ul>
 
The script implements conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red, and returns the tickers with the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease and greatest total volume.
